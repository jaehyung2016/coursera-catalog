<h2>Coursera Catalog App</h2>
<p>This app lets the user browse and search for online courses offered through Coursera. The app relies on <a href="https://building.coursera.org/app-platform/catalog/" target="_blank">Coursera Catalog APIs</a> to retrieve the course information.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>I created this app to practice and improve my web development skills. The app is built with Ruby on Rails, and the following are the objectives I had in my mind developing this app:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn to use Web APIs (with HTTParty ruby gem)</li>
  <li>Learn to use HTML and CSS for page layout and styling</li>
  <li>Responsive page design for mobile devices as well as desktop computers</li>
  <li>Use javascript unobtrusively to seperate behavior from presentation</li>
  <li>Learn to use jQuery, AJAX, and JSON</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use of non-ActiveRecord model classes, partial views, and helper modules</li>
  <li>How to test models, controllers, and helpers with Rails built-in testing support</li>
  <li>How to debug Ruby on Rails applications with byebug and web-console ruby gems as well as logging</li>
  <li>How to use Git (a popular version control system software)</li>
  <li>A technique to prevent unnecessary downloading of hidden images for mobile devices</li>
</ul>
