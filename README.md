#Coursera Catalog App
This app lets the user browse and search for online courses offered through Coursera. The app relies on [Coursera Catalog APIs](https://building.coursera.org/app-platform/catalog/) to retrieve the course information.

##Objectives
I created this app to practice and improve my web development skills. The app is built with Ruby on Rails, and the following are the objectives I had in my mind developing this app:
*Learn to use Web APIs (with HTTParty ruby gem)
*Learn to use HTML and CSS for page layout and styling
*Responsive page design for mobile devices as well as desktop computers
*Use javascript unobtrusively to seperate behavior from presentation
*Learn to use jQuery, AJAX, and JSON

##Lessons Learned
*Use of non-ActiveRecord model classes, partial views, and helper modules
*How to test models, controllers, and helpers with Rails built-in testing support
*How to debug Ruby on Rails applications with byebug and web-console ruby gems as well as logging
*How to use Git (a popular version control system software)
*A technique to prevent unnecessary downloading of hidden images for mobile devices
